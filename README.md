# Extended C language

## What is C\*?
C\* is a language very very similar to C, but extends it to classes and polymorphism.  
And yeah, it's not C++, but may sound very similar.  
I have started writing it only because I want fast and optimised language.  
C++ has a lot of problems I want to fix.  
Let's take for example:  
imagine that you have two source files, each defining template function, e.g vector.  
If you defined vector<int> in a.cpp and vector<int> in b.cpp, then a lot of useless doubled functions  
will be merged into final binary file.

## How do I want to solve above problem?
C\* compiler will have a flag to parse each source file and basing on parsed data define each inclusive  
template function in one global object file, let's take that in current example, it has a name 'def.o'  
Finally the linker links def.o and each another .o file and then creates final executable file.  
C\* will also have a non-flag method to solve this problem. Each template class or single function will be able  
to be defined in one source file. There will be a keyword: 'export' and it will export each class method or  
single function.  
It is an example:
```ca
#include "class.ha"

export foo::class<int>::*
```
To tell a compiler to import class methods or single functions instead of create new static, there will a  
keyword 'import'. For example:
```ca
#include "class.ha"

import foo:class<int>::*
```
'import' is backward compatible with 'extern', but not vice versa.  
You cannot use 'extern' to express code above.

## Compatibility
C\* is fully back-compatible with C11 and partially with C++11, so you can compile C code using C\* compiler as well.  
To be able to extern C++ functions, one has to write: `extern "C++" { ... }`.  
There is no such need for C, because it is natural for C\* - uses the same mangling and conventions.

## File extensions
Language uses .ca for code definition and .ha for declaration.  
.ca is an acronym of C-Asterisk. Optonal name of the language.  
It is not .cs (from C-Star), because .cs is already occupied by C#.

## Nice features
C\* is designed to be fully configurable.  
User can choose its own symbol mangling for classes, etc.  
It is possible to convert C\* code to **clean** C code.  
This language is written with thought to be comfortable with OS development.  
Unicode function and variable names are also possible!  
(But, anyway, who names symbols in languages other than English, hmm)

## Compiler
Compiler of C\* is written in C in mind to be lightweight.  
I don't want to create a giant like gcc or clang. Just simple and efficient compiler.  
Code of C\* is compiled directly to ELF binary, because of speed. Optional method is compiling to NASM or  
GAS and then to binary.  
From the beginning, only supported architecture is x86\_64, but I plan to extend this to support i[3-6]86, arm and risc-v.
